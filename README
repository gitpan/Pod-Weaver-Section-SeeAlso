NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - add a SEE ALSO pod section

VERSION
      This document describes v1.000 of Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - released May 30, 2010 as part of Pod-Weaver-Section-SeeAlso.

DESCRIPTION
    This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that references the main
    module of a dist from it's submodules and adds any other text already
    present in the pod. It will do this only if it is being built with
    Dist::Zilla because it needs the data from the dzil object.

    In the main module, this section plugin just transforms the links into a
    proper list. In the submodules, it also adds the link to the main
    module.

    For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SEE ALSO"
    section in this POD :)

    WARNING: Please do not put any other POD commands in your SEE ALSO
    section!

    What you should do when you want to add extra links is:

            =head1 SEE ALSO
            L<Foo::Bar>
            L<Bar::Baz>

    And this module will automatically convert it into:

            =head1 SEE ALSO
            =over 4
            =item *
            L<Main::Module>
            =item *
            L<Foo::Bar>
            =item *
            L<Bar::Baz>
            =back
