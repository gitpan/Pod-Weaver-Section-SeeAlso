NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - add a SEE ALSO pod section

VERSION
      This document describes v1.001 of Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - released December 13, 2010 as part of Pod-Weaver-Section-SeeAlso.

DESCRIPTION
    This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that references the main
    module of a dist from it's submodules and adds any other text already
    present in the pod. It will do this only if it is being built with
    Dist::Zilla because it needs the data from the dzil object.

    In the main module, this section plugin just transforms the links into a
    proper list. In the submodules, it also adds the link to the main
    module.

    For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SEE ALSO"
    section in this POD :)

    WARNING: Please do not put any POD commands in your SEE ALSO section!

    What you should do when you want to add extra links is:

            =head1 SEE ALSO
            Foo::Bar
            Bar::Baz
            www.cpan.org

    And this module will automatically convert it into:

            =head1 SEE ALSO
            =over 4
            =item *
            L<Main::Module>
            =item *
            L<Foo::Bar>
            =item *
            L<Bar::Baz>
            =item *
            L<www.cpan.org>
            =back

    You can specify more links by using the "links" attribute or by
    specifying it as a comment. The format of the comment is:

            # SEEALSO: Foo::Bar, Module::Nice::Foo, www.foo.com

    At this time you can only use one comment line. If you need to do it
    multiple times, please prod me to update the module or give me a patch
    :)

    The way the links are ordered is: POD in the module, links attribute,
    comment links.

ATTRIBUTES
  add_main_link
    A boolean value controlling whether the link back to the main module
    should be added in the submodules.

    Defaults to true.

  header
    Specify the content to be displayed before the list of links is shown.

    The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SEE ALSO").

  links
    Specify a list of links you want to add to the SEE ALSO section.

    You can either specify it like this: "Foo::Bar" or do it in POD format:
    "Foo::Bar". This module will automatically add the proper POD formatting
    if it is missing.

    The default is an empty list.
