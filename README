NAME

    Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - add a SEE ALSO pod section

VERSION

      This document describes v1.003 of Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso - released October 25, 2014 as part of Pod-Weaver-Section-SeeAlso.

DESCRIPTION

    This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that references the main
    module of a dist from its submodules, and adds any other text already
    present in the POD. It will do this only if it is being built with
    Dist::Zilla, because it needs the data from the dzil object.

    In the main module, this section plugin just transforms the links into
    a proper list. In the submodules, it also adds the link to the main
    module.

    For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SEE ALSO"
    section in this POD :)

    WARNING: Please do not put any POD commands in your SEE ALSO section!

    What you should do when you want to add extra links is:

            =head1 SEE ALSO
            Foo::Bar
            Bar::Baz
            www.cpan.org

    And this module will automatically convert it into:

            =head1 SEE ALSO
            =over 4
            =item *
            L<Main::Module>
            =item *
            L<Foo::Bar>
            =item *
            L<Bar::Baz>
            =item *
            L<www.cpan.org>
            =back

    You can specify more links by using the "links" attribute, or by
    specifying it as a comment. The format of the comment is:

            # SEEALSO: Foo::Bar, Module::Nice::Foo, www.foo.com

    The way the links are ordered is: POD in the module, links attribute,
    comment links.

ATTRIBUTES

 add_main_link

    A boolean value controlling whether the link back to the main module
    should be added in the submodules.

    Defaults to true.

 header

    The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SEE ALSO").

 links
